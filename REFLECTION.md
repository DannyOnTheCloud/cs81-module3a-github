What did you learn about using Git and GitHub?
Github is very user friendly and to understand basic functionality it is very fast to learn. Although, maybe other advanced
niche features might be somewhat complicated as they might require an increase in experience. GitHub is an amazing online
repo that essentially has everything any repo can have which is why it is an industry standard. 

What was most confusing or frustrating?
The most frustrating thing was I guess creating a token and getting familiar with it as I had forgotten that in terminal 
when it asks you to enter your Github password you must enter your PAT(Personal Access Token) rather then a passsword. However,
after that was done it was simple and very clear to use. 

Why do you think developers use Git?
I think developers use Git because it is very user friendly for both beginner and advanced developers. I also think that
it allows an environment where it is easy for developers to collaborate and create code and changes all in the same 
environment. 

How might this help with larger projects in the future?
This could help me in larger projects in the future beacuse when collaboriating with other individuals maybe a group of 3 or more people
you can see the commits which are changes that they made. You can see what code was changed and find out where. If there
is some typ of error you can revert to an old version of your code. In addition PAT allows everything to be kept safe
and if you want your repo to by private you can make it private.
